## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first development

### What I learned

- I learned the proper use of practice tag in html for an optimize image loading process in the webpage and I deeply developed my skills in CSS. 
- This is my 4th accomplished challenge from the Frontend Mentor website and I'm thankfull for these types of simple projects because it helps me build my confidence in building websites.
- I also felt like my skills in html and css keeps getting stronger as I go do these types of challenges. 

### Continued development

- I have built my skills a strong foundation of using html and css, but I will keep on learning the things that I already know so I wouldn't forgot them as they are important as other html tags or css properties.
- I am also developing my skills on responsive website layout and hopefully I can create a website with responsiveness in mind at ease.
